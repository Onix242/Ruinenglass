  Feature-set for engine: font rendering that allows zooming in
  closely, text-based VFX, cooperative 3D pathfinding upwards of 30
  entities (and up to 60 for level editing zoomed out from a
  distance), user-input typing in different languages and a mix of
  different languages and custom glyphs, automatic detection of
  keyboard layout, developer tools for art that are also user-facing
  tools for semi-procedural authorship (ASCII art, animation, music
  language creation, dialogue).

  If you're trying to learn, you should try to figure out the problem
  instead of trying to move on. Solving bugs is a huge part of
  programming and a skill that is important and will benefit you more
  than moving on faster (in my opinion).

  Division of labour that separates engine work from gameplay
  programmer work. Where inefficiencies gets folded into engine
  related code. ECS is a way to understand this from a game designer
  POV, where's it's not ideal from the perspective of the programmer.

  JBlow - To use an ECS is to optimise for the size of the entity
  data, but that's like 2MB that would fit in an L3 or maybe L2
  cache. Not worth to ship.

  A few advice:
  - If you can't find the solution after 2 hours, take a break. Often
  when you come back you'll find the solution quickly.

  - Don't try to solve the issue by comparing the code to Casey's. Try
    to figure out why your code behaves differently and than verify it
    with the handmade hero code.

  - Use the debugger, place a breakpoint in the
    Win32ProcessKeyboardMessages function and look in the call stack
    from where it was called. Inspect variables don't assume their
    values are correct.

  - Keyboard and mouse input debugging is sometimes harder because
    pausing the program with the debugger will make you release the
    key and so no more message for that key will be received if you
    step. Logging messages with OutputDebugString helps a lot in those
    case. But be sure to also output messages for marking the frame
    start, the start and end of processing windows messages and other
    important step in you main loop. This should make it obvious in
    the log if something happens at an unexpected time.

  - If you ask for help, provide your code (if possible with a simple
    way to compile it), not a screenshot, otherwise we won't be able
    to help you.

  RESOURCE(ivanecky): https://hero.handmade.network/forums/code-discussion/t/124-thinking_about_frame_update
  Two schools of thought about Frame Updating
  - First (Casey's)
    = You're at time T when the frame switches. Frame spans from T to
      T + 1, you're calculating what happens in-game at time T to T +
      1; You're trying to predict what the game state will be when the
      next frame switch happens.
      > The problem is it doesn't handle variable framerate, because
      you're PREDICTING what the state will be at time T + 1, so you
      cannot account for variable framerate.

  See Tiny Glade's talk comparing their technology to Lumen's nanite technology.
  - Second (Seems every tutorial and article is):
    = You're at time T, you're calculating what happened to game
    state since time T - 1.
      > The ugly thing is you're displaying state of game from time T at
      time T + 1.
      > I think that this isn't real problem though, because it doesn't
      matter that you're offset by one frame from game time (if you're
      consistent with it).
      > Benefit of this approach is you're handling variable-framerate
      well, cause you always know how much has game time advanced since
      last frame switch.
